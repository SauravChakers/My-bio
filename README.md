# My-bio
International experience in treasury, cross asset trading, financial & capital risk management, debt issuance and corporate finance. Highly skilled project and general manager with a demonstrable record of delivering consistently substantial revenues. A detail oriented individual who can step back to develop, communicate and obtain buy in for the bigger picture. Proven ability to adapt, innovate, incubate & transform businesses and generate sustainable results via strong team skills together with recruitment, coaching and management experience. Resilient against adversity with uncompromising ethical standards. 
At the end of Course 1, I can now identify, source and perform basic cleansing on data, conduct exploratory and descriptive analytics, use SQL to query and analyse databases and construct data driven stories using more impactful tools such as Tableau. In a nutshell, I have taken my first baby steps into coding using SQL and learnt new technologies such as Tableau and advanced Excel. 
By end of Course 2, I expect to have developed my coding skills further and learn an additional language in the form of Python which was the main reason I subscribed to the CA. I am also hoping to develop my broader data and presentation skills whilst continuing my career coaching journey where I want to identify my zone of genius and how to use all these new skills to pivot towards a more fulfilling career.
