# My-bio


👋 Hi, I’m @SauravChakers
👀 I’m interested in coding, financial markets and how we can harness AI & ML to make better investment decisions
🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of Python
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any or all of the topics I've listed in my interests or any other cool applications of Python
📫 To reach me email me sauravchakers@gmail.com


International experience in treasury, cross asset trading, financial & capital risk management, debt issuance and corporate finance. Highly skilled project and general manager with a demonstrable record of delivering consistently substantial revenues. A detail oriented individual who can step back to develop, communicate and obtain buy in for the bigger picture. Proven ability to adapt, innovate, incubate & transform businesses and generate sustainable results via strong team skills together with recruitment, coaching and management experience. Resilient against adversity with uncompromising ethical standards. 

At the end of Course 1 of LSE Data Analytics, I can now identify, source and perform basic cleansing on data, conduct exploratory and descriptive analytics, use SQL to query and analyse databases and construct data driven stories using more impactful tools such as Tableau. In a nutshell, I have taken my first baby steps into coding using SQL and learnt new technologies such as Tableau and advanced Excel. 

At the end of Course 2 I have developed my coding skills further and learnt an additional language in the form of Python which was the main reason I subscribed to the course. I have also improved my data parsing skills and developed my broader data and presentation skills.  My career coaching journey has helped me to identify my zone of genius and how to use all these new skills to pivot towards a more fulfilling career.  

Course 3 has helped me develop more advanced statistical skills and how to use them in Python & R enviroments. I am learning about different predictive techniques such as linear regression & mutiple linear regression. I am also now more aware of other types of regressions such as polynomial, lasso and principle components. I have improved my understanding of the linkages between correlation and regression.
